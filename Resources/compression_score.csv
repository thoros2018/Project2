The best soy latte that you ever had and me But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet? Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And head back toward the Milky Way? And tell me did you sail across the sun? Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated?  And tell me did you fall for a shooting star One without a permanent scar? And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?
